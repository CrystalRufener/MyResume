        <li><h2>Summary</h2><p>I love bringing ideas to life. Talking with clients, and creating from their ideas and adding some of my own and seeing the end results is so satisfying. I have always had apassion to see how things work. Mostly in technology, but haven't been able to really act on it until recently. I am a wife, mother, student, and work part time. The work I do currently is physical labor which I enjoy, as it gets me out of my brain for a bit, but I also love to write code and see how it come to life. I enjoy creating in my free time, but would like to have as a career as well as long as I can fit it into my already crazy life. </p></li><hr/>
